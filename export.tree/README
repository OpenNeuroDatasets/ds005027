## Data notes
Converted with mids2bids by Ryan Klaus and Mary Soules with support from Krisanne Litinas.
For some subjects MID runs for a session are unavailable/corrupt, so alternative session combo was recommended.

        --verbose-reports 
        -w /tmp/work -m bold T1w T2w
```

Command used for taskdescribe_v1.0:

For each session and run, there is a derivatives folder summarizing the behavioral data in an JSON or PNG image. These were calculated based on the associated events.tsv files. The PNG files are meant to be used as a quick summary of the behavioral performance throughout the task/run/session
